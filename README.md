# Project Title: IC Management System 

## Problem Statement
Labs often struggle with organizing and tracking ICs. We have also struggled finding the right ICs for our DLD and CA projects This project will help keep an organized inventory while providing efficient search and retrieval operations, ensuring ICs are available for lab work.

## Solution
1. Catalog Management (Linked Lists)
   - Store details of ICs (name, type, stock count) in a singly linked list.  
   - Dynamically add or remove ICs as needed.  

2. Borrow and Return System (Stacks and Queues)
   - Use stacks to implement undo/redo for catalog changes.  
   - Maintain a queue of borrowers requesting ICs to handle operations fairly.

3. IC Search (Trees)
   - Use a binary search tree (BST) to enable quick searches for ICs by name or ID.  

4. Sorting and Searching
   - Use linear search to find ICs in the linked list (simplified search for small catalogs).  
   - Implement a sorting algorithm (like selection sort) to organize ICs by name.
