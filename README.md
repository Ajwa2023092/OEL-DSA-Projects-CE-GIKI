## How To Upload Your Project:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Go to the repository page and click on the **Fork** button at the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**:
   - You can upload your files directly using GitHubâ€™s web interface (described below).

3. **Create a Folder for Your Project**:
   - Inside your forked repository, create a new folder named after your project title (e.g., `Smart_Robot_Controller`).
   - Place your **source code** (e.g., `.cpp` file), **documentation** (e.g., proposal, PPT slides), and any other relevant files inside the folder.

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Scroll down to the **Commit changes** section.  
   - In the **Commit message** field, enter a short but descriptive message (e.g., `Added project files`).  
   - Choose **Commit directly to the main branch**.  
   - Click the **Commit changes** button to save your files.


6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - After pushing your changes to your fork, go to the **Pull Requests** tab on the main repository.
   - Click **New Pull Request** and select your fork as the source and the main repository as the destination.
   - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request (e.g., "Project Submission: Smart Robot Controller").
   - Submit the pull request.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your project folder is named clearly, and the files are organized properly.
